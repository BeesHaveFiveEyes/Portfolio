                    <p>On this page you'll find a collection of some of my web design work from over the years. In each case, I designed the sites in Sketch or Adobe XD before creating them by hand in HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the web.</p>

                    <h3>Poolhullock Farm</h3>
                    <p>One of my most recent web-design projects was designing and building a website for a farm in England. I was contracted to create a simple but elegant site using photos taken by the farm workers of the farmland, crops and animals. I particularly enjoyed the chance to experiment with colourful images of the farm's produce, and hope the website will be published soon!</p>

                    <h3>Bilingüe</h3>
                    <p>This project involved designing a landing page for Bilingüe, a proposed language-learning startup aimed at connecting language learners with native speakers. With this design, I enjoyed encorporating some simple hand-drawn elements – as has become something of a trend lately – such as the underline beneath 'like a native' in the image below.</p>

                    <p>This site was built as a purely personal project back when I was learning the fundamentals of web-design with HTML and CSS. </p>

                    <h3>OxReady</h3>
                    <p>This site was built for a proposed student-led tutoring company. The main aim here was to acheive a formal, academic look to the sight whilst keeping the design modern and inviting. I was particularly pleased with the integration of the first image on the landing page – I wanted the text to be perfectly placed on the college lawn as seen below, which was a challenge when the site had to adapt to any possible screen width and zoom level, but in the end well worth the extra effort!</p>

                    <h3>Domingo Website</h3>
                    <p>After releasing my first iOS app <a href="Domingo.html">Domingo</a>, I was thrilled that its daily puzzle became part of the daily routines of so many of my friends and family. However, as the app was only available on iOS, its audience was limited to Apple users. I experimented with making an android version of the app, but wasn't ultimately happy with it, so ended up releasing a simple web-version of the game instead along with the landing page seen below.</p>
