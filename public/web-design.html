                    <p>On this page you'll find a collection of some of my web design work from over the years. In each case, I designed the sites in Sketch or Adobe XD before creating coding them by hand in HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the web.</p>

                    <h3>Bilingüe</h3>
                    <p>The website below was created for a friend who was considering launching a language-exchange program aimed at pairing language learners with native speakers. Whilst the project never got off the ground, I really enjoyed creating the site and experimenting with various playful design features such as the hand-drawn underlines and accents.</p>

                    <h3>OxReady</h3>
                    <p>This site was built for a proposed student-led tutoring company. My main aim here was to achieve a formal, academic look to the site whilst keeping the design modern and inviting. I was particularly pleased with the integration of the first image on the landing page – I wanted the text to be perfectly placed on the college lawn as seen below, which was a challenge when the site had to adapt to any possible screen width and zoom level, but in the end well worth the extra effort!</p>

                    <p>One of my most recent web-design projects was designing a website for a farm in England. I was asked to create a simple but elegant site using photos taken by the farm workers of the farmland, crops and animals. </p>

                    <h3>Domingo Website</h3>
                    <p>After releasing my first iOS app <a href="Domingo.html">Domingo</a>, I was thrilled that its daily puzzle became part of the daily routines of so many of my friends and family. However, as the app was only available on iOS, its audience was limited to Apple users. I experimented with making an android version of the app, but wasn't ultimately happy with it, so ended up releasing a simple web-version of the game instead along with the landing page seen below.</p>
